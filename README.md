# folder-creator
## A simple C# WinForms project that creates repetitive folders with a given name.

First you choose the path where the folders will be created. Then you specify how many folders to create and folder names to be created. The result is the desired number of folders with the desired name.
<br>This was an old project that I used to need in a specific situation.
